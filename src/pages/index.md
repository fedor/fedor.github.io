# About me

Hello,

My name is Fedor. I'm a software engineering manager, team lead, architect, and (occasionally) programmer. I'm currently based in [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong). I was born and raised in Russia but has left it for good in 2014.

I love quality, simplicity, and good food ;-)
