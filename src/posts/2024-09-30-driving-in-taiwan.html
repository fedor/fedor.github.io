	I've recently got my first ever driving license and
	was driving for the first time on my own yesterday.
	We rented a car and went to the
	<a href="https://www.nmmba.gov.tw/En/">National Museum of
	Marine Biology and Aquarium</a> in the south.
</p>

<p>	
	The trip there was okay, it was during the day, roads were
	clear and Google Maps worked as expected.
</p>

<p>
	The trip back was not so pleasant.
</p>

<p>
	1. It took place during the dawn and after the sunset. I
	suddenly discovered that my side windows were tinted. That's
	really dumb. It greatly affects visibility, changing lanes
	and getting on highways was not fun. I understand that the
	sun is a concern, but come on! There are ways to cover
	windows whenever the car is parked in the open, and most
	of the UV rays are stopped by the regular glass anyway. Seems
	fully or nearly-fully transparent anti-UV coating is also
	an option. Once I made my observation, I discovered that
	most cars in Taiwan have a visible tint. Beware, they are
	also half-blind at night.
</p>

<p>
	2. Navigation with Google Maps works... until it doesn't. As
	I was on a highway, my phone started losing a GPS signal for a
	brief moment triggering re-routing. After re-routing the
	navigator app mistakenly assumed I was <b>under</b> the highway and
	navigated me back on it. It happened a few times. One time I
	got confused and exited the highway one exit too early. With
	that I had to make my way through the city. Google did an
	OK job but I wish it gave me more detailed instructions.
	For example: the main road and a slow lane separated by a
	safety island, I need to turn right and must do it from the
	slow lane. "Take the left lane to turn right" is
	technically a correct instruction, but "turn right to the
	slow lane to turn right in 200 meters" would be much better.
</p>

<p>
	Overall it was okay for the first time. Navigation issues
	were minor and it's just a matter of experience.
	But I'd probably avoid driving in Taiwan unless I buy my
	own car and get rid of a dumb tint.

	PS we saw cute Beluga whales! They were

	not Russian spies</a>.
